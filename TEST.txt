20 QUERIES WE USED:
GOOD RESULTS
- cristina lopes 5 ms
- computer vision 257 ms
- mondego 1 ms
- acm 27.498
- software engineering 207 ms
- sql 26 ms
- thornton 25 ms
- icssc
- ics33
- machine learning


NOT SO GREAT
- master of software engineering, master of computer science, results not really relevant only somewhat...
- github for same reasons
- optimized by downplaying vague / unhelpful words / adjusting weights. also consider when "Master of Software Engineering" is in title

- ics 33, words completely not relevant
- consider when query is joined together and in url

- ACM, didn't show any results with acm in it, but fixed by considering tokens when lowered and in title,
- 26 ms when optimized

- to be or not to be or some stop thing a about himself does further cannot above after, time at 3000 ms :skull:
- limited words to 7 words or less and also limited posting retrieval, time at 128 ms

- to be or not to be, time sucked was at 1000 ms
- managed to reduce it down to 700 ms still sucks, but better
